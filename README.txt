This is the code to reproduce the analysis of the study: Bayesian interpretation of non-inferiority in transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement trials: a systematic review and meta-analysisBy:Samuel Heuts, MD, PhD, Michal Kawczynski, MD, Peyman Sardari Nia, MD, PhD, Jos G. Maessen, MD, PhD, Giuseppe Biondi-Zoccai, Andrea Gabrio, PhDAll Bayesian analyses were performed by the first author (SH) in JASP (https://jasp-stats.org/), which is an R-based statistical program. R coding has been derived from the JASP application. Further non-Bayesian analyses were performed in R by the second author (MJK) and both were verified by the last author (AG).
