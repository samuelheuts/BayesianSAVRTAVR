All Bayesian analyses were performed by the first author (SH) in JASP (https://jasp-stats.org/), which is an R-based statistical program. R code export in JASP for Bayesian meta-analysis is not yet available. Therefore, the JASP settings for the analyses and the used parameters are extensively described in the manual. When JASP is updated to export R codes, this manual will be adapted accordingly. Further frequentist meta-analyses were performed in R by the second author (MJK) and both Bayesian and frequentist analyses were verified by the last author (AG).
